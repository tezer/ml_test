"I have been using Monzo as my main bank since October 2017 (I was part of the beta who had early access to the full current account).

Monzo being a mobile only bank was a little daunting at first, but I soon found that this didn't matter at all (only slight annoyance is not being able to pay in cheques and cash). The budgeting tools are amazing and have actually helped me save enough to put a deposit down on a house!

The only issues I have ever experienced have been the result of third-party issues, for which Monzo have been apologetic and have said they are taking steps to prevent the issues from happening again.",['824.company-brand.general-satisfaction.0']

"Easily the UK's worst bank

I was a customer of Santander UK for a few years before deciding to switch my account. They are easily the country's worst bank. I was in another continent travelling and found my card locked. I spent over 1 hour and 30 minutes on hold to Santander (at international calling rates) to try and fix my card issue to no avail. In a separate instance, they refused to send my card to my new address, citing security reasons and that instead, I would have to go to a branch. That branch was closed for 5 days in a row (for no apparent reason) which left me sans card. The branch staff were apologetic in the end, but they conceded that it was the organisation's fault and not their own.

In short: their customer service centres are awful to deal with. It seems to be a fundamental problem with the bank.","['824.company-brand.general-satisfaction.0', '824.company-brand.competitor.0']"

"How can a bank provide such an non-functional service and continue to survive?!

I have had several encounters with them recently, the first two resulted in me closing my account and the most recent just made me laugh.  The first time was them charging me fees on several occasions but never going overdrawn and taking ages for them to accept the mistake and refund me.  The second time was blocking my card and online account due to a technical issue with the way the system that attempts to detect fraud.  When closing my account as a result of these problems I was told that you cannot close an account on weekends due their system not working on weekends.

More recently after closing my account I thought I would use them to change back some foreign cash (as they had quite a good rate).  I spoke over the phone to them (which was a mission getting through to them) and confirmed that I could do this yesterday (Sat) and what the rate was.  On arrival at the bank I queued for 15minutes only to be told their system doesnt allow foreign currency transactions on weekends.

"Great and intuitive platform. Easy to use and serves the purpose of a simple banking instrument for someone as me, an expat.

However, the card use left me disappointed, albeit the good support provided by the live agents. At the moment, left my home country of Portugal for Angola and, when trying to use the card for the first time, it was refused / operation annulled. Second time, another establishment, same.  This forced me to go back to conventional bank card, incurring in small taxes that were perfectly avoidable. When contacted by the live agent, was informed that a new card would be needed but, given that Angola does not have postcodes, it is not possible to send, even with the company where I work in address. 

Given that other expats here used Chatterbank card chip and pin, I can't find justification for the card not working (card in pristine shape) and that I will have 6 months of taxes to pay each time it is used before arriving in Portugal, to recover a card. Together with this, to avoid taxes, will force me to open a local bank account and transfer monthly wage to this bank and use another card for monthly expenses (with bank fees incurring from account management)

Given this, I can not recommend Chatterbank. Can and surely say that the platform is visually excellent, a great tool for online payments, support is quick and nice but no solution was available when the card didn't work and the main goal of Chatterbank was not accomplished for me (worldwide use, no taxes)",['824.company-brand.general-satisfaction.0']

Now on May i cannot remember the exact date someone sent me a payment of 90 pounds i thought it was my friend the only people who have my account number and sort code are my parents and some of my friends i asked my friends who sent me the money one of them said they did so i didn't bother about it or worry as it was only 90 pounds but they lied my account number and sort code was used for payment then on June 18th on the website shpock i put an item up for sale for 80 pounds the buyer paid straight away and wanted the item straight away so i was going to post the next day as the time was  3pm then all of a sudden like 2 minutes go by my online banking app restarts and i see it shows i have no accounts to display i was panicking and i immediately called nationwide they said there was a report of a fraudulent credit i was shocked i then knew this buyer is a scammer how can someone send an item to you when you just placed the order today that doesn't make sense so then i was told my account will be closed in 60 days i was actually devastated  and angry i went to my local branch to see what was going on there was this guy i hated him soo much he was a rude person he spoke to me like i am some sort of criminal a convict i walked out of the bank angry i will never be banking with them again.

TSB expect their customer's to login into their bank account on a daily basis to monitor an inbox that they store electronic communication for you to read. This is an unreasonable expectation.

Whilst privacy is an important factor, a simple email to a real mailbox informing us that there is a message waiting would resolve this issue. A basic and common sense solution which would not cost them anything except for the initial development of this feature.

Why so much security, who is gonna have my phone, card, and login number and then ring up answering all the other security questions correctly and still not being able to log in online because they have to send a passnumber through the post! It's 2020, why would you send it through the post! If anyone is looking to go to a bank, dont let it be nationwide, YOU WILL REGRET IT!!",['824.account-management.account-access.0']

Beware if you are getting this to use the free international transfer facility. My first attempt was returned failed after 2 weeks minus a CAD50 fee. Customer service was poor and slow to respond. After 6 days of “investigating” they told me Chatterbank cannot make this payment (to a major credit union in Canada) because they are an unrecognised 3rd party (quite concerning) and suggested I use my personal bank account instead (Halifax were able to process the transfer no problem and funds received in Canada in less than 24hrs albeit with the usual fees). They also refused to refund the 50 dollar fee that I was charged despite admitting that the reason for failed transfer was out of my control.

Original review:
Avoid them like the plague!
Especially if you are using them with any significant money or plan to do so. They locked my account with months of savings kept hostage. Their support never replies. If I try using Facebook Messenger, phone or other means, they will just give automated or generic answers to redirect me to the in-app chat, where I can't actually talk to anybody, as it is forever stuck ""Looking for an agent...""

The update to 4.11.0(33) caused the app to stop working and complained my phone was rooted. I had high hopes this morning when an update to 4.12.0(36) appeared. However still the same issue. My phone is not rooted and works with Google Pay and NetFlix which both require Safety net to pass. Your developers obviously added some additional security checks after version 4.10.0(18) - whatever these were please remove them as they are falsely detecting root on non-rooted devices. Update 27-06-2020 - managed to get this working by renaming or removing the TWRP folder on the sdcard.

They distributed about 4/5 different letters and I needed to remember all of these details and it took a very long time for it to all come.which for starters was highly inconvenient as I was without my promised railcard for a number of weeks. Eventually I got all of my details and I tried setting it up and this is when it gets absurd. They told me that I'm not eligible for one as I didn't set up my railcard in the time frame in which was necessary, laughable. I then went to withdraw some money and my card was sucked into their ATM and it didn't give me it back, I rang them up and they said that they would issue me a new debit card within the next 2-3 working days. Judging by their already terrible service it was obvious that it wasn't going to turn up for a couple of weeks and I would be unable to make any transactio

"I've been a long standing customer of HSBC bank and generally happy with it until yesterday. 

To begin with, I went on a work-related trip abroad in mid-March and got stuck there due to the COVID-19 travel restrictions. In May I have contracted the virus and still am recovering, being quarantined in Moscow without any perspective to return home until mid-June in a best case scenario.

One of my HSBC accounts is a joined one, which I use alone since divorced the other person on the account months ago. Normally, I was transferring the Child Maintenance money from this account to her and then moving the remaining amount to my personal account. 

On the payday I transferred the money to the joined account as usual, but then realised that I can't make any transactions from it. All my money for the month are blocked. Having called the customer support line, I was advised that the bank has some 'security concerns' over my address since they sent me some correspondence I did not respond to. 

For over 40 min on an international call I was trying to explain the situation to an agent with a distinctive accent, but only heard something about 'policies' and was advised to send proof of address by post and also have my ex on the phone with me while on call. Explaining that neither is currently feasible did not convince the helpful  HSBC customer service agent and I asked to connect me with the manager. After 10 minutes wait I was cut off.

Called again, this time they kept me on the line for about an hour but with the same outcome.

As a result, I am stuck abroad deprived of access to my money because the bank cannot confirm my address which is ridiculous on its own since they confirmed my identity, my son can't get the maintenance money and naturally I have other financial obligations to serve. Not sure how I am going to get out of this one with financial shortage only being part of the problem.

Are these people totally void of any common sense and care for the customer these days? Those procedures they have may normally be reasonable, but the current situation with COVID-19 chaos where people are stranded abroad, cannot leave their homes or experiencing serious health issues, requires to look at each case based on individual circumstances if they want to retain their customer base.

Or is it a some kind of weird way of getting hold of money to make them work for the bank while the customer is denied access to them?

I am totally disgusted in any case, an absolute shame.","['824.company-brand.general-satisfaction.0', '824.company-brand.competitor.0']"

"The lack of flexible working hours has become very apparent during the restriction in the United Kingdom. Branches now long longer opening on Saturday meaning there is a further backlog of people needing access during the week, which also now has reduced hours. The reduced hours in the week make it almost impossible to visit a branch for anybody who works typical hours. They blame this on the restrictions and reduced work however alternative branches such a Natwest, Lloyds and most notably Metro Bank have opening hours on Saturday and Sunday. I hope this will be assessed in the future and this culture of banks opening late, closing early and not having suitable weekend opening times is something that will be recognised as an inconvenience that isn't suitable for todays customers needs.

"There is a reason why there are SO many bad reviews on here about the Halifax.  The customer experience is absolutely shocking.  The majority of call handlers in the Halifax call centre are cold, unfriendly and to a large extent unhelpful. You are never left satisfied at the end of the call.  If you do decide to complain about the level of service received they will ""uphold"" your complaint.  I've had a couple of problems with this bank in recent years and it does really seem that it is getting worse.  
Only use this bank if you want poor customer service, a lack of respect for it's customers, a bank that really doesn't give its customers ""Extra"" and wastes millions of pounds on television advertising campaigns featuring cartoon characters, slinkys and flashing disco lights!

The app is ok but not a patch on NatWest’s for functionality and ease of use. My biggest bug bear is that the ability to show future dated payments once existed but was taken away. Please reinstate!

Chatterbank is a breath of fresh air when it comes to online banking.  I am a metal user and I am very happy with this service since it also allows me to experiment with the stock market and create special cards for buying from particular websites or services without compromising my main daily credit card.  The only grip I have with this service and the reason why I do not give 5 stars is that more often than not I am having a lot of issues with top ups which do not work especially when I need to make a sizable purchase which would bring me some good cash back.

"Without any prior notice (letter, email, phone) my accounts were all stopped. No money owed, no debt!! Tried to move money in between accounts to pay bills and nothing would work. Contacted on the phone and no one could tell me who put the block on and they could not take it off. Put through to security team and they could not even tell me. Very worried by this point. Eventually found out after another 2 calls that it was 'Compliance Team' but they had closed for the day (was a Fri at 5:30pm) and did not open back up until Mon 8am. Left without any access to money over the weekend. All week then tried to get accounts unblocked but wanted to speak to my partner who is only on one joint account we have, not any of the other 3 we have that they had blocked. Not interested in speaking to me even though it is my money in the account. She had to go into the local branch and even the bank manager had no clue what was going on. Bank manager made a formal complaint, as did we, against the whole situation. This dragged out for a whole week and my partner had to explain, and prove, where our money came from, where it went, prove income, expected inheritance, send copies of both our passports away, etc. Personal info you really do not think anyone has any right to know, let alone a bank. Still to this day (2 weeks) we have had no access to any of our money (bills overdue) until Ronald in Compliance team is satisfied with answers. Beware of this bank, Compliance Team and Ronald (Compliance Team). Very ignorant and arrogant. Contacted the financial ombudsmen who will act if we are no further forward by certain dates. Luckily I have a credit card which I rarely use that I have been living off. Oh and its a Santander one which I can not pay off until they let me into accounts, couldn't make it up. 10 plus phone calls to get this sorted and no one seems to care, see the problem or want to help. Choose another bank people. If and when this is sorted I will be moving everything away from them. If I could rate minus 10 I would.

This applies to current, savings, business and credit card accounts.  Just lucky I don't have a mortgage with them too.

Customer services can always find a way to ensure you never get exactly what you need from being unable to pay full balances, to being unable to update addresses, to getting me on telephone banking so I can do these things, to calling back when they promise to or getting things done on time.

I reported fraudulent activity on my card for thousands of pounds and they even made that so difficult that I never got the money back.

To put it bluntly - they suck. At banking, at customer service, at being helpful, at  being efficient. Pretty much everything. 

One by one I've moved my money and my families money elsewhere - because if there is a way to mess things up for you (whilst charging you for it in the process) Barclays will find a way.

I transferred some money out, which was supposed to be 'turbo' speed. That took almost an hour to arrive in the recipient account. Next, I tried to avail of the supposedly free SEPA transfer only to receive a ""recipient blocked"" error, after filling in all the details over several screens. So, yes. You can set up an account instantly, top it up with your debit card and convert to other currencies.

"I am an NHS worker, and non stop worked through the COVID-19  pandemic and during that time I fell to a financial scam lost over £109,000.00 to a love scam in April- July 2020 lockdown. RBS did no security checks and tried to blame me for creating a payee. They refuse to acknowledge that money generally can't be sent without creating a payee, but RBS being a bank should be able to help and protect my money, so if it has been sent to a scam company, this could have been stopped, and my account frozen, contact from RBS questioning me about my transaction could have alerted scam. But RBS took no actions as they say no errors made from their end. How are they protecting their customer from becoming victims of fraud? What is the point of RBS having a fraud/scam team if they are taking no actions. I have waited 3 months and still waiting to hear a response from RBS via Financial Ombudsman for an outcome. I as NHS worker working to protect the public from COVID-19 and RBS thinks I have all the time to keep chasing everyone for my money. Why would a lockdown preventing RBS from communicating??? To RBS over £109k is nothing, and easy for RBS to ignore and delay, but to an average working person it is a life savings. Please show some compassion.
